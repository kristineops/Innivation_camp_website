      <h2>About Save the Children</h2>
      <p>Founded in 1919 by <em>Eglatine Jebb.</em>
         Save the Children soon became the first global movement for children. 
         Established in Norway in 1945, focusing on the rights of children impacted by the Second World War. 
         Leading, independent global experts on children rights. 
         Save the Children works in 123 countries, reaching around 155 million children.

      <h3>The problem:</h3>
      <p>Due to the corona virus, many children are taken out of school in order not to spread the infection. This is for their own saftey, but can cause several problems when they return to their education. Save the Children has several concerns about childrens return to school, escpecially in rural countries. Some of their concerns are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Children must return to school when its <strong>safe</strong>.</li>
        <li>We fear many children will not return to school.</li>
        <li>We do not have good enough data on why children are out of school.</li>
        <li>We do not use the data we have efficiently.</li>
        <li>The data do not reach someone that can do something about it.</li>
      </ol>

    <div class="solution">
      <h3>The solution - How to track attendence:</h3>
      <p>Radio frequency identifiers - RFIDs. Compared to other
        technologies such as Bluetooth, biometrics, barcode or the aforementioned web
        technologies we realized it came out on top on flexibility, simplicity, speed and
        except for the web technologies and Bluetooth, in distance too!
        </p>
        <p>On top of that, passive RFID tags, which are the ones we are focusing on here
            today, last virtually forever and when purchased in high volume come at
            only 1.25 NOK per tag.
        </p>
        <p>An RFID equipped reader that is capable of handling the data we are after,
            such a terminal does vary wildly in price, we have found them ranging
            between as little as 5000 and as much as 200000 NOK depending on diverse
            specifications. Even if we focused on the most expensive few of the bunch,
            they still come up on top when compared to other systems. Their batteries can
            either be recharged using simple solar panels, interchangeable batteries or by
            periodically recovering the terminals to gather the accumulated data,
            recharging the batteries, and delivering them back.
        </p>
        <p>Another benefit is that thanks to the range we can ensure that the technologies
            aren´t salvaged for materials by encasing them if necessary.
            The nature of RFID tags allow them to hold up to 32kb. That´s enough to
            hold the entire Declaration of the United States of America around five times
            and a half. Needless to say your benefit is that you can ensure you obtain data
            from name, age, gender, and anything else you could need from the user.
            <strong>But how to do that?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The best way implementing this idea was by using reusable
            and recyclable rubber bands that come with an adjustable strap so that it can
            be passed on onto any student of any size and age. The rubber bands are
            durable and contain the RFID tag, an ID number and are also grey, so that they
            are gender neutral and can contrast with the environment in case of loss.
        </p>
        <p>Since the terminal holds data of attendance and lack thereof as well as the students
            information, both instructed teachers and Save the Children can benefit from
            obtaining all sorts of data that they can use to make sure their efforts are being
            focused on the right spot.
